THE OLD WORLD - A CRUSADER KINGS MODIFICATION
=============================================


THERE WAS ALWAYS MORE TO THE WORLD THAN JUST 
HUMANS... LURKING JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE...

AS WILLIAM THE CONQUERER TOOK HIS PLACE ON THE 
ENGLISH THRONE & AS GENGHIS KHAN LAID THE 
FOUNDATIONS FOR THE LARGEST CONTIGUOUS EMPIRE 
IN HISTORY, THERE WERE CREATURES OF BOTH GREAT 
AND TERRIBLE POWER, SKULKING IN THE SHADOWS OR 
HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT AMONG KINGS & MEN.

THIS IS THE OLD WORLD.
